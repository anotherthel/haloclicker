      When you start out, you have $20, which is (shouldn't you have figured it out?) the base currency of the game.<br>
      The first actions you do are a) buy a 'camp' which gives 1 housing:</p>
    <img class='img2' src='/howToPlay/imgs/img1.png' alt='button to buy housing.'>
    <p class='pp'>
      After you've done that, you should have $10 left, which leaves enough to buy (1) marine:
    </p>
    <img class='img2' src='/howToPlay/imgs/buyMarine1.png' alt='Buying marine (1)'>
    <p class='pp'>
      Now that you have bought a unit, you will notice that at the bottom left corner, you have started "battling"<br>and will slowly earn money.
    </p>
    <img class='img2' src='/howToPlay/imgs/img2.png' alt='No alt.'>
    <p class='pp'>Now you can do whatever, read on, or just clickthe helmet.</p>
